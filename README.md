# Work Day Scheduler

## Details
In this assignment, I used jQuery, Day.js, and Bootsrap to build this work day scheduler. Bootstrap made the webpage so easy to build with its prebuilt components. jQuery was interesting to use. It took a while to stay consistent with which language I was using. I'd often catch myself wondering why a code wasn't working and then realize I mixed vanilla JavaScript with jQeury. After awhile, it just became really convenient to use.

This application was relevant to my personal interests so it made it enjoyable to code. I already use apps and widgets like this to stay on top of my busy schedule. 

You'll notice that the time slots uses a 24-hour clock--which is something I prefer in a scheduler. The user will be able to insert events at various hourly slots. At this time, they must click save for each hour the change to save the information. As time passes, the page will automatically refresh every hour in order to change the color of the slots. These colors would reflect past, present, and future events. Events in the past will be colored yellow, present events are red, and future events are green.

## Website
Here are a couple screenshots of how the website looks like. This schedule uses a 24-hour clock.
